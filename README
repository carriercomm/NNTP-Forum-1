The purpose of this project is to create a fully-functional webforum that uses NNTP instead of SQL to access its data.

This application uses rackup, and should support any server that supports rackup.  It has been tested under Apache2 CGI and the supplied .htaccess file sets the necessary mod_rewrite rules to make that work.

== Dependencies ==

All dependencies **can** be installed without rubygems.  I have done it.  For most of them you can just copy the contents of lib/ into your ruby path.  Most of them are not packaged for real package managers, unfortunately.
